    | MULTIPLE device script
    | Author: Jamie Caesar
    | Email: jcaesar@presidio.com

    This script will grab the output for a list of commands from the provided list of devices.  The list of commands is
    taken from the 'settings/settings.ini' file.  There is a separate list for each supported network operating system
    (IOS, NXOS and ASA) and by default the list that matches the network operating system of the connected device will
    be used.

    Custom lists of commands are supported.  These lists can be added manually to the [document_device] section of the
    'settings/settings.ini' file.  To be able to choose one of these lists when running the script, the
    'prompt_for_custom_lists' setting needs to be changed to 'True' in the settings.ini file.  Once this option is
    enabled, the script will prompt for the name of the list that you want to use.  If the input is left blank then
    the default behavior (based on network OS) will choose the list.

    NOTE:
    The Custom list can be set on a PER DEVICE basis if a column names "Command List" (case sensitive) is added to the
    device list CSV file that is selected when running this script.  If the "Command List" column is missing or the
    field is left blank for a device then the list will be chosen using the default behavior (i.e. use the list
    specified when running the script, or based on the network OS of each device).

    **Script Settings** (found in settings/settings.ini):

    * | **show_instructions** - When True, displays a pop-up upon launching the script
      | explaining where to modify the list of commands sent to devices.  This window also
      | prompts the user if they want to continue seeing this message.  If not, the script
      | changes this setting to False.
    * | **folder_per_device** - If True, Creates a folder for each device, based on the
      | hostname, and saves all files inside that folder WITHOUT the hostname in the output
      | file names.  If False, it saves all the files directly into the output folder from
      | the global settings and includes the hostname in each individual filename.
    * | **prompt_for_custom_lists** - When set to True, the script will prompt the user to
      | type the name of a list of commands to use with the connected device.  This list
      | name must be found as an option in the [document_device] section of the
      | settings.ini file.  The format is the same as the default network OS lists, 'ios',
      | 'nxos', etc.
    * | **ios** - The list of commands that will be run on IOS devices
    * | **nxos** - The list of commands that will be run on NXOS devices
    * | **asa** - The list of commands that will be run on ASA devices

    **Any additional options found in this section would be custom added by the user and are expected to be lists of
    commands for use with the 'prompt_for_custom_lists' setting.**

    By default, The outputs will be saved in a folder named after the hostname of the device, with each output file
    being saved inside that directory.  This behavior can be changed in the settings above.
