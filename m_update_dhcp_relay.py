    | MULTIPLE device script
    | Author: Jamie Caesar
    | Email: jcaesar@presidio.com

    This script will scan the running configuration of the provided list of devices, looking for instances of old IP
    helper/DHCP relay addresses (IOS/NXOS) on interfaces and if found will update the helper/relay addresses with the
    newer ones. The new and old addresses that the script looks for is saved in the settings.ini file, as documented
    below.

    Any devices that cannot be connected to will be logged in a separate file saved in the output directory.

    This script will prompt you to run in "Check Mode", where the configuration changes the script would be pushed to
    the devices are ONLY written to a file and NO CHANGES will be made to the devices.  If you select "No" when prompted
    this script will push the configuration changes to the devices. Also, when the changes are pushed to the devices
    this script will save the running config before and after the changes are made, and will also output a log of the
    configuration sessions showing all the commands pushed.

    **Script Settings** (found in settings/settings.ini):

    * | **show_instructions** - When True, displays a pop-up upon launching the script
      | explaining where to modify the list of commands sent to devices.  This window also
      | prompts the user if they want to continue seeing this message. If not, the script
      | changes this setting to False.
    * | **old_relays** - This is a comma separated list of IP addresses that the script should
      | search for as relay addresses in the device's configuration.
    * | **new_relays** - This is a comma separated list of IP addresses that are the new relay
      | addresses that should be added to any interface that has at least one of the old
      | helper/relay addresses on it.
    * | **remove_old_relays** - If True, the script will add the new relays and REMOVE the old
      | relays immediately after adding the new ones.  If False (default), the script will
      | only add the new relays to interfaces where at least one old relay is found.  This
      | is useful when you want to push out new relays as part of a migration process
      | without removing the old relays.  Since this script will not try to push new relay
      | addresses that already exist on an interface, the script can be run again with this
      | option set to True to later remove the old relays.
