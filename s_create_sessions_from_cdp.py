    | SINGLE device script
    | Author: Jamie Caesar

    This script will grab the detailed CDP information from a Cisco IOS or NX-OS device and create SecureCRT sessions
    based on the information.  By default all sessions will be created as SSH2, so you may have
    to manually change some sessions to make them work, depending on the device capabilities/configuration.

    Only devices that contain "Router" or "Switch" in their capabilities field of the CDP information will have sessions
    created for them. This skips phones, hosts like VMware or Server modules, and other devices that we don't usually
    log into directly).

    **NOTE ON DEFAULTS**: This script uses the SecureCRT Default Session settings as a base for any sessions that are
    created.  The folder where the sessions are saved is specified in the 'settings.ini' file, and the hostname and IP
    are extracted from the CDP information.  All other setting defaults are configured within SecureCRT.

    **Script Settings** (found in settings/settings.ini):

    * | **folder** - The path starting from the <SecureCRT Config>/Sessions/ directory where
      | the sessions will be created.
    * | **strip_domains** -  A list of domain names that will be stripped away if found in the CDP remote device name.

                    SecureCRTSession or DirectSession)
